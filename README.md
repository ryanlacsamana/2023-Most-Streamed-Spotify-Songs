artist(s)_name |name of the artist(s) of the song|
artist_count |number of artists contributing to the song|
released_year   |year the song is released|
released_month  |month the song is released|
released_day    |day of the month the song is released|
in_spotify_playlists    |number of Spotify playlists the songs is included in|
in_spotify_charts   |presence and rank of the song in Spotify charts|
streams |total number of streams in Spotify|
in_apple_playlists    |number of Apple Music playlists the songs is included in|
in_apple_charts   |presence and rank of the song in Apple Music charts|
in_deezer_playlists    |number of Deezer playlists the songs is included in|
in_deezer_charts   |presence and rank of the song in Deezer charts|

bpm |Beats per Minute, a measure of song tempo|
key |key of the song|
mode    |mode of the song (Major or Minor)|
danceability_%  |percentage indicating how suitable the song is for dancing|
valence_%   |positivity of the song's musical content|
energy_%    |perceived energy level of the song|
acousticness_%  |amount of acoustic sound in the song|
instrumentalness_%  |amount of instrumental content in the song|
liveness_%  |presence of live performance elements|
speechiness_%   |amount of spoken words in the song|



**Additional Notes for Musical Ratings**

- danceability_% - A value of 0 is least danceable, and 100 as most danceable.
- valence_% - Low valence sound more negative (e.g: sad, depressing, angry), while high valence sound more positive (e.g: happy, cheerful, euphoric)
- energy_% - Higher value sounds more energetic.
- acousticness_% - 100 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
- instrumentalness_% - The closer the instrumentalness values is to 100, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content (ooh and aah sounds are treated as instrumental). Values above 50 are intended to represent instrumental tracks.
- liveness_% - higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track is performed live. A value above 80 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.
- speechiness_% - Values above 66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 33 and 66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, including rap music.

### **1.1 Objectives**

1. Clean the data.
2. Identify relationship between variables.
3. Identify how the track metrics (danceability, energy, valence, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, and speechiness) relates to the number of streams, chart placement, and frequency in playlist of a certain track.
4. Share insights and findings through visualization and observations.

### **1.2 Methodology**

1. Create additional columns as necessary and modify values from certain columns to ease the analysis.
2. Check for null values and incorrect datatypes. Apply necessary measures to remove or replace these values.
3. Explore the data
4. Plot relationship between variables using visualization tools available in Seaborn and Matplotlib.
5. Write an observation based on the results of the analysis.
